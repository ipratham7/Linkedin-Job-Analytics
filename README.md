# Linkedin-Job-Analytics
LinkedIn Job Analytics is a data-driven project that provides real-time insights into job availability, sectors, and geographical distribution based on LinkedIn data, empowering users with valuable information for the Indian job market.
# Project Description
The LinkedIn Job Analytics project aims to provide insights into the job market in India by collecting data from LinkedIn job postings. The project involves the following steps:

Web Scraping: Utilize Python and BeautifulSoup to scrape job data from LinkedIn. This includes extracting information such as job titles, companies, locations, salaries, and other relevant details.

Data Storage: Store the scraped data in a database using SQL. This allows for efficient data retrieval and analysis.

Data Analysis: Perform analysis on the collected job data using SQL queries. This can involve various queries to gain insights such as the most in-demand job sectors, popular companies, average salaries, and geographical distribution of job opportunities.

Visualization: Create visualizations using Excel to present the analyzed data in a clear and meaningful way. Visualizations can include charts, graphs, and tables to highlight trends, comparisons, and patterns within the job market.

# Analysis Generated
1. Job Providers: The cities of Gurgaon, Pune, Mumbai, and Bangalore emerged as major job providers across all levels. These cities offer a significant number of job opportunities in various sectors.

2. Dominant Industries: The IT Services industry showcased the maximum number of vacancies, indicating a high demand for professionals in this sector. It was followed by the Management Consulting and Financial Services industries, which also presented a considerable number of job openings.

3. Company Size and Job Openings: Companies with a larger number of employees overall tend to offer more job openings. This suggests that organizations with a substantial workforce have a greater demand for new talent.

4. Geographical Distribution of IT Jobs: Bangalore emerged as the city offering the most IT jobs. It was followed by Gurgaon and Pune, indicating these cities as significant IT job hubs. Mumbai, on the other hand, offered the most Management Consulting jobs, followed by Hyderabad.

5. Social Media Influence: The analysis revealed that companies with a larger number of followers on social media platforms do not necessarily translate into more job offers. The number of social media followers does not directly correlate with the number of job opportunities provided by companies.

# Dashboard and Visualization
The project includes a dashboard created in Excel to present the analyzed data. The dashboard consists of the following interactive charts and visualizations:

1.City-wise Job Distribution (Bar Chart): This chart displays the number of job opportunities in different cities. Users can compare the job availability across cities in a visually engaging bar chart.
